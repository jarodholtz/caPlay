# caPlay

Welcome to caPlay's git repo.  This is where we store documentation for our thoughtful, playful events.

If you are a customer, these documents will let you "peek behind the curtain."

If you are a partner or contractor, these documents will help you get up to speed so that you can make each event both impactful and fun.

Regardless of who you are, we host our documentation on github in order to encourage all members of our community to have their voice heard.

Have an idea for how to make our events even better?
Make a copy of the repo, make any changes you want and propose them for official adoption with a pull request.

Feel free to reach out through our website if you have any questions:
