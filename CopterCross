Quadcopter Obstacle Course Relay Race
In this executive workshop your group will learn how to fly quadcopters through a series of “tiny tasks.” Participants will work in pairs and will rotate between being the student with their hands on the controller and the instructor that uses cheat sheets to provide guidance through each new skill.  After they’ve mastered the fundamentals, they will compete head-to-head in teams of two or four in an Obstacle Course Relay Race tournament.  The winning team will be crowned as champions.

Likely Big Take-aways 
Breaking tough technical challenges into a series of tiny tasks makes them both easier to approach and easier for everyone involved to learn.  
Simple pieces, in combination, solve complex problems.
A basic understanding of quadcopters and drones.
Clear communication between the pilo and the instructor.

Big Questions
Are there learnings to take away from this pair-learning process?  What about the User Experience design?
When you automate these flight patterns (drones) and add analytics on top of the sensor collection (video, sound, LiDar, and other sensors), what possibilities start to emerge?
How will the increasing application of drones and analytics: 
Impact the fringes (or core) of your customers industries?

==
Quadcopter obstacle relay race
-work on teams
-walk people through training
-talk about breathing slowly to make minute changes w/ joystick
-cheap copters to break
-have one person go first, (probably Buzz); let one person go and watch them crash.
“That’s the hard way to learn. Here is the easy way to learn.”
Biting off in small chunks.
-series of tests they have to pass. Move on to the next one. Move on to the next one.
-Eventually they’re flying pretty solid. 

-Eventually change to more expensive drones.
-Fly using a  FPV (first person view) screen
-Start doing practice runs on the obstacle course
-Eventually might fly only by FPV
-Setup obstacle course: Take control of drone; do a challenge; land drone; hand controller to teammate and they do a series of obstacles. 

Practice runs
Practice relay runs: Timed OR Tournament style. Final is “quad cross”

Interested in outside but would like an indoor backup venue.

Had 10K, but might be able to get away with 12-13K for 50-60 people

Looking for a perfect outdoor venue host for an interesting educational exercise in late October. Designing a group of 30 business executives from Europe. 

We’ve worked with this group for several years every October, fun, level headed folks. 

I’m sure you’ve been to a boring conference or listened to a dry lecture before? 
We think lectures suck too so we try to teach through a playful experience.

The goal of the workshop is to show how breaking tough technical challenges down into a series of tiny task makes it easier to approach and learn for everyone involved within a company from the top on down. 

They’ll work in 15 pairs and rotate between being the student and the instructor. They’ll have cheat sheets and a checklist to learn each new skill.  After they’ve mastered the fundamentals, they’ll compete in  mini Obstacle Course Relay Race. 

Do you know what quadcopters are?
